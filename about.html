      <div class="question">Q:What is the origin of your name</div>
      <div class="answer">A: It's quite a silly story but essentially when I first came back to CS:GO right before CS2 I was just rocking the name Chicken with a profile picture of a Chicken, essentially a shitpost name and profile picture.
      I was playing a game on Cache, and the entire enemy team were coordinated and were all named "Horse on a Balcony", "Horse on a Car", etc. and so I was like okay well I want to join them. I looked up if there was a picture of a Chicken
      on a Horse, and somehow found one. I swapped my name and my profile picture and the rest is history, I of course got my own profile picture done at some point down the line.</div>
